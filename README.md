The simplicity of the interface is made on purpose to reduce distraction and emphasize focus. **Spend less time learning the app and more time working.** Check it out [here](https://eduardoltorres.github.io/pomodoro/).

## How Does It Work?
After you choose the number of sessions you'd like to be working for, the timer will start. Every 25 minutes you get a 5 minute break. Every 4 sessions you get a 30 minute break.
