# Pomodoro Timer üçÖ
A minimalistic pomodoro timer.

The simplicity of the interface is made on purpose to reduce distraction and emphasize focus. **Spend less time learning the app and more time focusing.** Less is more.

## How Does It Work?
After you choose the number of sessions you'd like to be working for, the timer will start. Every 25 minutes you get a 5 minute break. Every 4 sessions you get a 30 minute break.
